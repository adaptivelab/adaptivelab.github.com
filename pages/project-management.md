Make sure you know what you're building
------------------------------------

Even if you think you know exactly what you're about to attempt when grabbing a new task off the pile, it's always a good idea to double-check with whoever created the task in the first place that you'll be delivering what's expected.  If deliverables are clearly defined, they indicate to you exactly what it is you'll be demoing to the team at the end of a sprint, which means there will be no last-minute rush to change it all around because you forgot to add this or that.

If a task doesn't put a specific deliverable in your mind, don't be afraid to ask for clarification.
