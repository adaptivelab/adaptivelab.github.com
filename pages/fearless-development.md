Confidence is an important factor in getting started quickly on a new task and also in knowing when it's complete and ready for sign-off.  When you're
afraid of all the unknowns, when the setup is confusing and unfamiliar and when you're terrified that whatever you do could break the code
that's already in place, that's when productivity takes a nose-dive.

Throughout this guide we talk about the ways in which the software practices
we stick to can aid your confidence as a developer: having a thorough test suite as a rock-solid base to work on; separating out deployment environments so
that you can sandbox your app with ease; adding monitoring in early to save head-scratching time later; making reusable components sooner rather than later for you and your developer friends; it's all good.
