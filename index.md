Whether you're developing for us or thinking about doing so, this guide is here to let you know how we work.  It describes our approach, covering the key aspects of modern software development that we've taken to heart, but
also how we apply those techniques to give confidence to our developers and to the end users of the awesome stuff we build.

Confidence is an important factor in getting started quickly on a new task and also in knowing when it's complete and ready for sign-off.  When you're
afraid of all the unknowns, when the setup is confusing and unfamiliar and when you're terrified that whatever you do could break the code
that's already in place, that's when productivity takes a nose-dive.  Throughout this guide we talk about the ways in which the software practices
we stick to can aid your confidence as a developer: having a thorough test suite as a rock-solid base to work on; separating out deployment environments so
that you can sandbox your app with ease; adding monitoring in early to save head-scratching time later; making reusable components sooner rather than later for you and your developer friends; it's all good.

[1. Fearless Development](https://github.com/adaptivelab/adaptive-development/blob/master/fearless-development.md)
------------------------

This chapter describes how we help new starters feel like they know what they're doing and know how to get stuck in without worrying about 'breaking' things.


[2. Using Git](https://github.com/adaptivelab/adaptive-development/blob/master/using-git.md)
---------------------------

We use git and github and we go with the git flow.


[3. Testing](https://github.com/adaptivelab/adaptive-development/blob/master/testing.md)
-------

Testing is an incredibly important part of ensuring quality.  Here's why as a developer you should want to employ good testing techniques from the start, not as an afterthought.


[4. Ensuring Quality](https://github.com/adaptivelab/adaptive-development/blob/master/ensuring-quality.md)
------------------------

Here we talk about the best way to make architectural decisions as a team, reviewing each other's code and how pairing up can help ensure projects move in the right direction.


[5. Reusability](https://github.com/adaptivelab/adaptive-development/blob/master/reusability.md)
----------------

Reusable code saves time for the next time.  When something is self-contained, why not package it up and open-source it?


[6. Environments](https://github.com/adaptivelab/adaptive-development/blob/master/environments.md)
-------------

Your own development environment is important, but is a personal choice.  This chapter focuses on the multiple environments an application should run in and how keeping them in mind from the start can help you avoid problems later.


7. Deploying
----------

How to set up servers for deployments, how to release and when to release.


[8. Indicators](https://github.com/adaptivelab/adaptive-development/blob/master/indicators.md)
--------------

How stats and analytics are vital for keeping apps up and running and for improving them over time.


[9. Security](https://github.com/adaptivelab/adaptive-development/blob/master/security.md)
------------

What needs protecting and how to protect it.  How to keep secrets.


[10. Project Management](https://github.com/adaptivelab/adaptive-development/blob/master/project-management.md)
----------------------------

Our agile approach.
