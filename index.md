[1. Fearless Development](pages/fearless-development.html)

This underpins our development ethos.  Many of the other topics are there to enable us to establish an environment in which new starters and regulars alike can dive straight into the next task fearlessly.

---------------------------

We use git and github and we go with the git flow.


[3. Testing](pages/testing.html)
-------

Testing is an incredibly important part of ensuring quality.  Here's why as a developer you should want to employ good testing techniques from the start, not as an afterthought.


[4. Ensuring Quality](pages/ensuring-quality.html)
------------------------

Here we talk about the best way to make architectural decisions as a team, reviewing each other's code and how pairing up can help ensure projects move in the right direction.


[5. Reusability](pages/reusability.html)
----------------

Reusable code saves time for the next time.  When something is self-contained, why not package it up and open-source it?


[6. Environments](pages/environments.html)
-------------

Your own development environment is important, but is a personal choice.  This chapter focuses on the multiple environments an application should run in and how keeping them in mind from the start can help you avoid problems later.

----------

How to set up servers for deployments, how to release and when to release.
